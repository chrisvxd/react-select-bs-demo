react-select-bs-demo
=================
A basic example implementation for bootstrapping [react-select](https://github.com/JedWatson/react-select) into a traditional non-react web app with no module loading system (i.e. using `<script>` tags rather than `require` or similar).

There are both vanilla js and babel (jsx) versions included.
